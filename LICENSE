<h1>Software License Agreement for Downloaded Version 6</h1>

<p>This Software License Agreement for Downloaded Version 6 (this "Agreement") is between you (either an individual or an entity, referred to hereinafter as "you" or "your") and MH Sub I, LLC dba vBulletin, and its affiliates and resellers ("vBulletin", "we", "our" or "us") for the vBulletin software that accompanies this Agreement, as may be updated or replaced by feature enhancements, software updates or maintenance releases including the vBulletin 6 Software, any previously released vBulletin Software under a different version, related explanatory written materials and files ("Documentation"), and any other add-ons or related products (together, the "Software") and any services, including but not limited to the Maintenance Service, Forum Support, Phone and Ticket Support, and Professional Install/Upgrade, that may be provided by vBulletin under this Agreement (together, "Services").</p>

<p>By copying, installing, downloading, or using all or any portion of the Software, you accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. vBulletin owns all intellectual property in the Software. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Software. This Agreement is enforceable against you and any legal entity that obtained the Software and on whose behalf it is used.</p>

<h2><strong>1. Software License.</strong></h2>

<p>Provided you comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and have paid the applicable license fees, vBulletin grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license to install, download and use a single instance of the Software on a single website domain in a manner consistent with its designs and Documentation as further set forth below and not for purposes of resale or re-compilation, re-distribution, re-syndication, time sharing or use for the benefit of any third-party (the "License"). Upon vBulletin&#8217;s receipt of the applicable license fees, a unique license number will be issued to you.</p>

<p>1.1 Limited Use. You may not transfer, rent, sublicense, assign, lease, loan, resell for profit, redistribute, encumber, publish or otherwise share the Software (or related materials based upon the Software or any part thereof) without the prior written consent of vBulletin. You must not use the Software other than as permitted by the License or in a manner inconsistent with its design and Documentation.</p>

<p>1.2 Notices. The Software must contain vBulletin&#8217;s copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software, unless you purchase a Branding Free License in which attribution of vBulletin is removed from the global footer (&#8220;Branding Free License&#8221;).</p>

<p>1.3 Illegal Activity. You may not use the Software to engage in or allow others to engage in any illegal activity where the Software is accessed and/or used. You may not use the Software to engage in any activity that will violate the rights of third parties, including, without limitation, through the use, public display, public performance, reproduction, distribution, or modification of communications or materials that infringe copyrights, trademarks, publicity rights, privacy rights, other proprietary rights, or rights against defamation of third parties.</p>

<p>1.4 Domain Use. The Software may only be used on a single website domain. Any modification of the Software intended to circumvent the foregoing is prohibited and will result in revocation of the License. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the License may be transferred to another domain with vBulletin&#8217;s prior written consent and a transfer fee subject to the vBulletin then-current fees.</p>

<p>1.5 Need for Content Licenses. The License provides no rights with respect to any content that may be reproduced, encoded, distributed, transmitted, performed, or otherwise used in connection with the Software. You are responsible for ensuring that any content is properly used in accordance with applicable laws and the rights of any third party with respect to such content.</p>

<p>1.6 Backup Copy. You may make one (1) copy of the Software in machine-readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. You may only use the backup copy if the original copy of the Software is no longer usable and the only way to use the Software is to reinstall the Software by use of the backup copy. Any permitted copy of the Software that you make must contain the same copyright and other proprietary notices that appear on or in the Software, unless a Branding Free License is purchased.</p>

<p>1.7 Test Copy. You may make one (1) additional temporary test copy for the purpose of testing code, template and database modifications. Such a test copy must not be made available to the general public at any time.</p>

<p>1.8 Modification of the Code. You may modify the Software source code; provided, however, you may not rent, sublicense, assign, lease, loan, resell for profit, distribute, publish or otherwise share the Software or related materials or derivative works based upon the Software or any part thereof without the prior written consent of vBulletin.</p>

<p>1.9 Pre-release Software Additional Terms. If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software ("Pre-release Software"), then this section applies. The Pre-release Software is a pre- release version, does not represent a final product from vBulletin, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss and may only be used for testing purposes. vBulletin may never commercially release the Pre-release Software. vBulletin may alter features, licensing terms, or other characteristics of any version of the Pre-release Software that it releases. If you received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, ("Test Agreement") for Pre-release Software, your use of the Software is also governed by the Test Agreement. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and the Test Agreement, the Test Agreement controls. You may not disclose, publish or disseminate any information regarding the Pre-release Software to anyone, including but not limited to any new features or faults to any Internet forums. YOUR USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 AND 8 FOR WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.</p>

"Update(s)" will mean the release of a version of the Software containing improvements, corrections, modifications, alterations, revisions, extensions, language versions, and/or enhancements to the Software and/or Documentation made during the term of this Agreement. The change to an Update will be recognized by an increase in value of any numbers to the right of the first decimal point (e.g., version 6.0.0 can be replaced by either version 6.0.1 or version 6.1.0). In order to install an Update, you must possess a valid license to the previous version of the Software and have active Maintenance Service in place (as described below). Once an Update is installed, this Agreement pertains to the Updated version of the Software, which you must agree to prior to downloading any Update. We recommend you install all Updates that specifically contain bug fixes.</p>

<p>1.11 Maintenance Service. The &#8220;Maintenance Service&#8221; allows you to download applicable Updates of the Software while such Maintenance Service is active. The Maintenance Service will be considered active for one (1) year after the purchase of the Software License. After the first year of purchasing your Software License, you can purchase an additional Maintenance Service for continued access to applicable Updates to your Software License. Each Maintenance Service has an active term of one (1) year from date of purchase of such Maintenance Service. If you do not renew your Maintenance Service upon termination of the applicable period in which such Maintenance Service is active, you will not be able to access Updates to your Software License (however, if a security patch is released, such patch will be made available during inactive periods of Maintenance Service).</p>

<p>1.12 Payment/Fees. You will pay, and authorize vBulletin to charge, any applicable fee using your selected payment method, associated with downloading the Software, purchasing a Maintenance Service, or any other applicable Services. vBulletin may change pricing of the Services at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
